# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jsonrpc-glib:
jsonrpc-glib: Jsonrpc-GLib is a library to communicate with JSON-RPC based 
jsonrpc-glib: peers in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion. It also 
jsonrpc-glib: allows communicating using the GVariant serialization format 
jsonrpc-glib: instead of JSON when both peers support it. You might want that 
jsonrpc-glib: when communicating on a single host to avoid parser overhead and 
jsonrpc-glib: memory-allocator fragmentation.
